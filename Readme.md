<center>Abstract</center> 
In this project we aim to accurately diagnose pneumonia using convolutional neural networkswith hope to augment the diagnosis by specialists. Chest radiographs are one of the mostcommonly available screening data. The dataset we are working with are images in DICOM(Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format taken from NIH Clinical Center​[1]​.Our primary motivation behind doing the project is getting familiar with medical imageclassification using neural networks. Diagnosis is a very sensitive and specialized field inhealthcare, we think machine learning can have a huge impact on it. One of the mostchallenging problems in the medical field is proper and early diagnosis, as in the case ofCOVID-19, or any other life threatening disease. We hope to apply the theoretical conceptstaught in the class with some new techniques that will help us understand the subject inpractical terms also.Keywords​: Machine Learning, Pneumonia, Convolutional Neural Network, Support VectorMachines, Logistic Regression.

### Setup instructions: 
1. Make sure you have jupyter notebook installed if not you can use google colab.
2. Dataset : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MWOW1T6wPalJALhYAp-YtdhWLd18CTMI
3. Main notebook : PneumoniaDetection.ipynb 
4. Report : main.pdf
5. 'svm_metadat.csv' and 'df_meta.pkl' are parsed image metadata. Used in SVM and Logistic regression.
6. Make sure dataset and all the required file are in same folder. Datasets should be inside 'rsna' folder.

Let us know if you have trouble accessing google drive link for dataset.
